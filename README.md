# Data-Science-Tutorial

Introduction to Python:

Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python that helps visualize data in various formats like line plots, histograms, scatter plots, etc.

Dictionaries: Data structures that store key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval based on keys.

Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python, primarily used for handling structured data through its DataFrame objects.

Logic, Control Flow, and Filtering: Concepts involving conditional statements, loops, and filtering data based on certain conditions.

Loop Data Structures: Iterative structures in Python such as for and while loops.

Python Data Science Toolbox:

User-Defined Function: Functions created by users to perform specific tasks, enhancing code reusability and modularity.

Scope: The visibility of variables in different parts of the code.

Nested Function: A function defined inside another function.

Default and Flexible Arguments: Assigning default values to function parameters and handling variable numbers of arguments.

Lambda Function (Anonymous Function): Small, anonymous functions defined without a name using the lambda keyword.

Iterators: Objects that allow iterating through elements in a sequence.

List Comprehension: A concise way to create lists in Python based on existing lists or iterables.

Cleaning Data:

Diagnose Data for Cleaning: Identifying issues or inconsistencies in the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics using various visualization and statistical methods.

Visual Exploratory Data Analysis: Using visual tools to understand the dataset's features and relationships.

Tidy Data: Structuring data in a standardized way for easier analysis.

Pivoting Data: Restructuring data to better analyze relationships between variables.

Concatenating Data: Combining datasets along axes.

Pandas Foundation:

Building Data Frames from Scratch: Creating Pandas DataFrame objects manually.

Statistical Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing data using statistical techniques.

Indexing Pandas Time Series: Working with time series data in Pandas.

Resampling Pandas Time Series: Changing the time frequency of the data.

Manipulating DataFrames with Pandas:

Indexing DataFrames: Accessing specific rows or columns in a DataFrame.

Slicing DataFrames: Extracting subsets of data from DataFrames.

Filtering DataFrames: Selecting rows or columns based on specific conditions.

Transforming DataFrames: Modifying DataFrame structures or values.

Index Objects and Labeled Data: Working with index labels in Pandas.

Hierarchical Indexing: Creating and working with multi-level index structures.

Stacking and Unstacking DataFrames: Changing the layout of DataFrames.

Melting DataFrames: Transforming wide-format data into long-format data.

Categoricals and Groupby: Working with categorical data and grouping data based on specific variables.

Each of these concepts is crucial in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python.
